# Test Report: Qualified Talent Addition Functionality

**Generated:** 2025-07-21 19:51:56

## Executive Summary

This report summarizes the results of automated tests performed on the "Add Qualified Talent" functionality.  Two test cases were executed: "Login" and "Add Qualified Talent". Both tests passed, indicating successful execution of the login process and the subsequent addition of a qualified talent record.  While the "Add Qualified Talent" test encountered a single warning regarding element visibility, this did not prevent successful test completion.  Overall, the system demonstrated robust functionality in this area.

## Test Overview

The purpose of this testing was to verify the functionality of adding a qualified talent record after successful login.  The tests covered the login process, file upload, and form completion for adding talent information.  Testing was automated using a framework that interacted with the application through specific UI selectors (IDs and XPaths).  The tests were executed using the Chrome browser.

## Detailed Results

**Test Case: Login**

* **Status:** PASSED
* **Steps:**
    * Launched Chrome browser and navigated to the login page.
    * Successfully entered credentials (`frpreprod1@kwiks.io`, `Kwiks.2025!`).
    * Logged in successfully.


**Test Case: Add Qualified Talent**

* **Status:** PASSED
* **Steps:**
    * Clicked 'Add qualified talents' button.
    * Clicked 'Browse Files' button and uploaded a file.
    * Clicked 'Next Step' button (twice).
    * Filled in form fields:
        * Current Salary: 10000
        * Desired Salary: 12000
        * Business Line: Information Technology & Software
        * Contract Type: Fixed-Term Contract
        * Additional Text Field: "a business analyst and good AI knowledgeable in general, a perfect condidate"
    * Automation completed successfully.

**Warnings:**

* One warning was encountered: "[WARNING] Element not visible for text input" during the filling of the form fields. This was likely due to a timing issue or asynchronous loading of the elements.  The test continued to run successfully despite this warning.


## Failed Tests Analysis

No tests failed during this execution.


## Recommendations

* **Investigate Element Visibility Warning:** While the test passed, the "Element not visible" warning should be investigated. This may indicate a timing issue in the automation script, requiring adjustments to wait times or the use of explicit waits.  Review the UI element loading to optimize performance.
* **Improve Logging:**  Enhance the logging mechanism to provide more detailed information about the elements interacted with, particularly those triggering warnings.
* **Error Handling:**  While no errors occurred, consider adding more robust error handling to the automation script to catch and report unexpected issues.


## Next Steps

* Investigate and address the "Element not visible" warning.
* Implement the recommendations outlined above.
* Expand test coverage to include additional scenarios and edge cases, such as invalid inputs and error handling.
* Consider adding performance tests to evaluate load times and response times.
